Project: Digital Heating Oil Counter
====================================

Welcome to the official documentation of the Heating Oil Counter project.

This project focuses on the development and construction of a precise, DIY-based measuring system to monitor heating oil consumption. In an era of rising energy costs and the growing need for household transparency, this system provides a cost-effective solution to digitally track current fuel levels and daily consumption.

Project Objectives
------------------

The primary goal of this project is to move away from manual estimations and mechanical gauges toward a data-driven monitoring approach. 

Key features of the system include:

*   **Real-time Tracking:** Monitoring the actual flow rate during burner operation.
*   **Consumption Analysis:** Calculating usage patterns over various periods (day, month, year).
*   **Smart Home Integration:** Connectivity with systems such as Home Assistant via Modbus.

Why this Project?
-----------------

Traditional mechanical counters are often imprecise or lack remote reading capabilities. This heating oil counter bridges that gap by combining modern sensor technology with a user-friendly digital interface. It empowers you to keep full control over your heating expenses—directly from your smartphone or computer.
